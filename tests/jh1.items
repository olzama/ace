"Second highest" is debatable, however. Since the ice cap was considerably thicker back then, it is rather likely that the summit was higher than Galdhøpiggen, even if the latter also had a glacier at the time.

A popular hike round in Jotunheim is from Gjendesheim or Bessheim via Glitterheim and back via Memurubu.
A popular round trip in the Jotunheimen mountains is the one that goes from Gjendesheim or Bessheim via Glitterheim and back via Memurubu.
A shuttle boat serves Gjende all summer long, and there are marked hiking trails to Memurubu, Leirvassbu, Spiterstulen, Olavsbu, Fondsbu and Torfinnsbu.
A similar sign is the presence of the Gjende flies that hover in swarms over the surface of the water during late summer days.
About 1880, a stone hunting lodge was built, but its use for this purpose was short-lived.
Access
Access.
According to reports, approximately 700 different plant species have been found in this area.
After a couple of kilometers, you can see the remains of the first Spiterstulen, under Styggehø on the other side of the river.
After a good half mile you will see the remains of the first Spiterstulen hut, below Styggehø, across the river.
After a number of renovations, the buildings so rich in tradition comprise an exceptionally harmonious complex of lodges that are pleasing to visitors.
After considering sites at Leirungen and Maurvangen, the choice fell on Gjendeoset.
After hiking one kilometer, you can see the remains of the first Spiterstulen at the foot of Styggehø, on the other side of the river.
After looking at potential sites at both Leirungen and Maurvangen, the lodge was placed at Gjendeoset.
After one kilometer, the route to Glitterheim branches off to the right, but we continue up Veslløyfti and Veslefjellet.
After one kilometer, the route toward Glitterheim bears to the right, but we continue up Veslløyfti and Veslefjellet.
After several alterations, the venerable building forms an unusually harmonious lodge enjoyed by visitors.
After sniffing out sites both at Leirungen and at Maurvangen, the lodge was placed at Gjendeoset.
After the throngs of hikers grew and DNT opened larger tourist lodges at both ends of Gjende, the stone cabin's single room with a fireplace and two simple bunks no longer was adequate.
Almost in any weather and ground conditions, it is possible to go hiking in the environs.
Almost regardless of weather and snow conditions, it's possible to go on a tour in these parts.
Along the way it bypasses first Sjugurtindtjørna and then Grunnevatnet.
Along the way it first passes Sjugurtind Pond and then Grunnevatnet.
Already during the historical age of migration, hunters found shelter underneath boulders located below where the tourist lodge stands today.
Already in 1874 Bamford sold Sikkilsdalen, and in 1881 the state bought it for horse breeding. Sjur Sande and his family were part of the package.
Already in 1874, Bamford sold Sikkilsdalen to a group of Christiania citizens.
Already in 1898, DNT purchased the lodge for use as an accommodation for tourists, or more correctly, as shelter for builders of a tourist lodge.
Also during hiking tourism's infancy, the area around Gjende was among Norway's most popular hiking region, and it was not without cause that DNT's first marked route was laid out in 1874 from Bessheim and across Veslefjell and Besseggen to Memurubu.
Also in the early days of hiking, the parts around Gjende were among Norway's most popular hiking areas, and it was not without reason that DNT's first cairn-marked route ran from Bessheim and over Veslefjell and Besseggen til Memurubu in 1874.
Also not far from Bessheim is Vågå Township's fine culture trail.
Although the lodge has changed, it is nonetheless the same family that has operated it since all the way back to 1870, and who still welcome guests.
Although the toughest part of your hike is done, you have a long way to go.
An Old Summer Farm

An interest in fishing is another good reason to visit the area.
And if you do not want to climb Glittertind, there are scores of other hiking possibilities around Glitterheim.
And if you don't want to go to Tinden, there is a throng of other splendid hike destinations around Glitterheim.
And it was Jens Tronhus on the neighboring farm who did the job.
And should you decide to skip that, there are lots of other fine hikes in the vicinity of Glitterheim.
Another indication is the Gjende fly, which may swarm in quantities over the water on hot late summer days.
Anyone approaching the hut from above can see how much gravel and sand the river has carried out into Gjende through the years.
Anyone coming over the mountain down toward the lodge will see how much sand and gravel the river has carried with it across Gjende up through time.
Apart from Vestfjorddalen near Rjukan, it was the area by Gjende, Norway's most beautiful mountain lake, where the fledgling DNT chose to put in its greatest efforts in the early years.
Around 1880, a hunting hut of stone was finished, but for that purpose it wasn't used long.
Around the valley there are 12 imposing peaks that rise to over 2000 meters elevation.
As already mentioned, the trip over Skautflya is an alternative to climbing Glittertind.
As early as 1898, DNT bought the hut for use as a tourist cabin, or more correctly, as lodging for those who who were to build a tourist lodge.
As early as during the Teutonic Migration, hunters found refuge under boulders on the down side of today's tourist lodge.
As for Besseggen, here it also may be wise to hike the opposite direction if you suffer acrophobia.
As for Besseggen, it may be wise to do this trip in the opposite direction if you are bothered by fear of heights.
As for the big hike round, it can be done in both directions, and there are several alternative routes on the way.
As mentioned, the hike over Skautflya is an alternative to the hike over Glittertind.
As mentioned, the trip across Skautflya is an alternative to the trek over Glittertind.
As the flow of tourists increased and DNT opened larger tourist lodges at both ends of Gjende Lake, the stone cabin's one room with a fireplace and two single beds were no longer adequate.
As the influx of travelers increased and DNT opened larger huts at both ends of Gjende, the one-room stone hut with a fireplace and two single beds no longer sufficed.
As with Besseggen, it may be a good idea to reverse the route if you dislike heights.
As you approach the summit, you come upon an increasingly magnificent panorama.
As you approach the top, you will encounter an increasingly impressive panorama.
As you start your descent, however, you had better watch your steps.
Aside from Vestfjorddalen at Rjukan, Gjende, Norway's most beautiful mountain lake, was DNT's principal development area in the early years.
Ask the people who work in Gjendesheim to take you across Sjoa, and then follow the path west along the shore of Gjende.
Ask the staff at Gjendesheim to ferry you across Sjoa. Follow the trail westward along the shore of Gjende.
Ask the staff at Gjendesheim to ferry you over Sjoa, and follow the trail westwards along the shore of Gjende.
At any rate, I suggest that you begin at Gjendesheim.
At high water levels, it may be difficult to cross; in this case, you will have to go farther up the hillside.
At the east end, Bessheim offered excellent lodgings, so DNT decided at its general meeting in 1869 to build a lodge at the west end.
At the eastern end, Bessheim offered excellent overnight accommodations, so that DNT voted at its annual meeting in 1869 to build a lodge at the western end.
At the highest point in the hollow, there is usually snow cover; be careful if it is hard and slippery.
At the top of the hollow there is usually a snowdrift, so watch your step if it is hard and slippery.

Back at the time of the migrations hunters sought shelter under some rocks located below today's hut.
Be that as it may, but Knutshø is well worth a day trip from Gjendesheim, being an "exposed" but perfectly safe hike.
Because of this, when the first tourists began to come to this part of Jotunheimen sometime during the 1800's, it was possible to find shelter in the primitive mountain farm buildings.
Before 1867 very few had.
Before 1867, not so many had.

Before being hatched, the larvae sit on rocks at the bottom of the river, providing food for the fish.
Before they hatch, the blackfly larvae lie on stones in the bottom of the river, vulnerable to feeding fish.
Before they hatch, the larvae lie on the surface of sunken rocks at the bottom of the river, exposed to feeding fish.
Begin at the bridge across Tjørnholåa and continue right to the summit.
Being at Gjendesheim is a pleasure, but the surrounding landscape is every bit as inviting.
Besides Vestfjorddalen near Rjukan, Gjende - Norway's most beautiful mountain lake - was DNT's most important region of operation during the first years.
Besides, next highest can be debated - when the first ascenders were on Glittertind, the summit snow dome was considerably higher than in our day, so it's entirely possible that the summit was then higher than Galdhøpiggen, even though at that time Galdhøpigg also had a summit glacier.
Besseggen and many other gems
Besseggen is not the only classic hike in Jotunheimen.
Besseggen is of course hiking destination number one, but here there are many other hiking destinations.

Hikers at the time naturally had some experience with "basic Norwegian mountain lodging," but even so, Gjendesæteren was often found too basic, prompting some to describe it as "a pile of rocks."
Hikers in reasonably good shape do Nautgardstind and Stornubben, on the eastern side of the valley, in a day.
Hikers of that time were of course accustomed to the range of «simple accommodations in the Norwegian mountains», but Gjendesæteren was still too primitive for many.

One follows the crest of the glacier westward; don't go too near the edge of the high, sheer northern wall.
One of them, that has become Bessheim tourist lodge, has since around 1865 belonged to the Storvik farm in Vågå and has been in the same family's ownership the whole time.
Only extreme weather would keep you from enjoying some outdoor activity in this area.
Only in 1901 was the hut ready for visitors.
Over the summit itself there's no marked route, so read the map carefully.
Over the years, the tracks from tens of thousands of hiker's boots have dug a wide, gray strip across Veslefjellet, but you don't need to go very many meters off the beaten track to discover that there are also plants at 1700 meters elevation.
Over time the tracks of tens of thousands of hikers have worn a wide, gray band across Veslefjellet, but straying slightly off the trail, you will see that there are still plants at 5500 feet, for the creeping azalea and glacier crowfoot are much less demanding than their kinsmen down below.

Thanks to them the hut is known as a great place to stay.
That hike takes an hour longer and is marked via the outlet of Bessvatn, where there is a bridge.
That route from Memurubu to Gjendebu takes about 6 hours, and may be an alternative for those who find Bukkelægeret too steep.
That was quite a cattle track, but the farmers kept their summer dairies anyway, because the grazing conditions here were so favorable.
That you do after having crossed the outlet on a bridge at the east end.
That's noticeable in the cheerful chat at the fireside of an evening.
The Celebrant
The Grand Round Trip
The Great Loop
The Hindsæter Hut has welcomed tourists since the 1860s.
The Huseby farm at Stange in Hedmarken long had a summer dairy here, and it must have been drudgery to drive a whole herd for days along country roads all the way up to Sikkilsdalen, almost 1000 meters above sea level!
The Minor Round-trip
The Shorter Loop
The State bought Sikkilsdalen to operate a stud farm, and Sjur Sande and his family were included in the consignment as lessees of Sikkilsdalsseter.
The area is said to have some seven hundred different plants.
The ascent from the hut to the top of Veslefjellet is 2460 feet, but the trail is wide and good, on a fairly even slope.
The big hike round
The birch reaches to almost four thousand feet, higher than anywhere else in Norway.
The bridge, by the way, is among the more airy, but safe enough (I was among those who built it!).
The bridge, by the way, is among the more windy ones, but it is safe enough (I helped build it myself!).
The cabin regrettably was destroyed by snow and wind, so today the weather determines how long you stay on the summit.
The cabin was unfortunately destroyed by snow and wind, so that today only the weather dictates how long you can remain on the summit.
The campground is in Vågå, Oppland, at 3280 feet, 26 cabins.
The ceiling blackened by smoke is an indication that many people have used the overhanging rock up through the ages (see photo p. 2).
The combination of hunting grounds and pasture for horses did not fare well, however.
The combination of the river's efforts and the benevolent climate has made the outer part of Memurudalen remarkably inviting, green and fertile.
The combination of the river's efforts and the favorable climate has also made the outermost portion of Memuru Valley unusually inviting, green and fertile.

The cousin of Henrik Wergeland, landscape painter Harald Nicolai Storm Wergeland, scaled Norway's next highest summit the year before, together with Hans Sletten from Lom.
The cousin of the author Henrik Wergeland, the surveyor Harald Nicolai Storm Wergeland, climbed Norway's second highest peak a year earlier, in the company of Hans Sletten from Lom.
The credit for this is due in no small measure to a line of faithful managers.

The environment was in any case conducive.
The famed hunter Jo Gjende thought for years that he had been first on top, since he had pursued a reindeer all the way to the top in 1842.
The final kilometers to Gjendebu go through terrain that becomes increasingly more fertile and green, and especially during the summertime, the flora is resplendent.

The glacier cap has no crevasses but may be slippery, especially in late summer, so it pays to bring crampons.
The government bought Sikkilsdalen in order to operate a horse-breeding center, and Sjur Sande and his family became part of the agreement, as tenants of Sikkilsdalsseter.
The great hunter Jo Gjende long believed that he had been the first man on "Tinden" after as early as 1842 having followed a reindeer buck all the way to the summit.
The great thing is that you can combine the trip to Spiterstulen with a trek to the summit.
The ground is fertile, the valley is sheltered, and the sun takes hold well.
The highest is Store Hellstugutind at 2345 meters.
The highest point in the valley itself is Uradalsbandet at 1663 meters, and from there it's mostly downhill.

The hike to the summit of Besshø is considerably longer but not particularly difficult.
The hike up Veslefjellet is short and easy and can readily be combined with a side trip to Bessvatn.
The hikers of the time were of course accustomed to quite a bit in the class "simple refuge in the Norwegian mountains," but Gjendesæteren was nonetheless too primitive for many of them.
The hillside is steep but can offer unique flora.
The hillside is steep, but it offers an excellent floral environment.
The hillsides around Gjende are extremely fertile and there is much to enjoy if you are interested in flowers.

The honor for that not least goes to a loyal line of wardens.
The hut is fully presented in Booklet 4
The hut is located in Vågå, Oppland, at 3280 feet, and has 48 beds.
The hut itself has changed considerably through the years, but the goal of the hikers in Veodalen has not changed much: hiking to the peaks and glaciers, with Glittertind being the prime destination.

This is also a long, narrow lake that curves into the mountains.
This is also a long, narrow lake that stretches in an arch in through the mountains.
This is considered a little more challenging than the other one.
This is noticeable by the fireside banter in the lounge during the evenings.
This is the larger of the boats on a beautiful summer day.
This makes it a long one, which can be broken in two by going via Leirvassbu (for details, see Booklet 4 in this series).
This popular loop trip in Jotunheimen runs from Gjendesheim or Bessheim to Glitterheim and back via Memurubu.
This proved to be a fortunate choice; a great number of visitors came here already from the beginning in 1878, and the numbers increased so much that the lodge eventually had to be expanded several times.
This surprisingly varied trail rambles through a lush landscape along an old tote road.
This trip from Memurubu to Gjendebu takes approximately 6 hours and may be an alternative for those who find bukkelægeret too steep.
This trip is also a classic.
This turned out to be a wise choice, for visitors flocked to it from its opening, in 1878, and the growing numbers led to several expansions.
This was DNT's third hut project.
This was DNT's third lodge project.
Though the lodge has changed, however, the same family that has managed it since 1870 welcomes guests.
Three Englishmen were responsible for putting Memurubu on the map.
Three miles farther on the trail forks by a large cairn.
Through Jo Gende, Bamford came in contact with Syver Sande, nicknamed Sjur, a well-known hunter and mountain man.

Through him Bamford met Syver Sande, usually called Sjur, a well-known hunter and mountain man.
Thus it was used for summer pasturage, and later a summer farm.
Thus, by the time the first tourists arrived in this part of Jotunheimen, some time in the 1800s, shelter was available in primitive farm huts.

To the south of Gjende there are also many options.
To this day, the Sande family operates Sikkilsdalssetra.
Today Gjendesheim is one of DNT's largest and most frequented huts.
Today the number of passengers on busy summer days calls for the use of two ferries to carry everyone wishing to travel between Gjendesheim, Memurubu, and Gjendebu.
Today's manager, Olav Gaute Vole, has worked here since 1974, later joined by his wife Bjørg.
Today's warden, Olav Gaute Vole, has been on the job since 1974, as time went by, together with his wife, Bjørg.
Today, Gjendesheim is one of DNT's largest and most frequented facilities.

Today, the influx of passengers is so great that on the most hectic days in summer, two passenger launches are in service to carry all who wish to travel by water between Gjendesheim, Memurubu and Gjedebu.
Together with his wife and two children he moved from Vågå, and he and his descendants stayed in Sikkilsdalen for nearly a century.
Together with his wife and two children, he moved from Vågå, and his descendants lived in Sikkilsdalen for almost a hundred years.
Tourists also learned early to appreciate Sikkilsdalen, and as early as 1870, the family's single cabin was too small, so Sjur added a guest room.
Tourists also soon learned to appreciate Sikkilsdalen, and when his family's house became too small in 1870, Sjur built another one, with a guest room.
Tourists began very early to appreciate Sikkilsdalen, and already in 1870, the family's one dwelling became insufficient and Sjur built an additional one with a guestroom.
Traces of their stay can be seen in the ground below the hikers' hut, including their stone stove.
Transportation
Transportation of materials and equipment from the village and into the long Veodalen valley, as well as the construction of the tourist lodge itself, took a long time.

Two marked trails lead to the summit; on either you should calculate 8 hours round trip.
Two routes are marked to the summit, and you had best reckon eight hours up and down.

Unfortunately wind and snow wrecked the hut, so your summit time is now dependent on the weather.
Up at the summit, the marked route from Bessheim meets the one from Gjendesheim.
Up on top, the marked route from Bessheim meets that from Gjendesheim.
Uppermost in the cirque there usually is a snowfield; be careful if it is hard and slippery.
Using Gjendesheim as a base, you can also make a week-long circuit that takes you through much of the grandest Jotunheimen can offer, with many potential side trips, a couple of them including the country's two highest peaks.
Vestiges from the Englishmen's stay may be seen on the grounds just below the tourist lodge; the stone oven they used for baking is still there.

We are not talking about a lot of names; the job of manager at a DNT lodge has a tendency to become a lifelong duty, which is again often passed on to the next generation.
We continue, however, along the trail to the left and down Bukkelægeret.
We do not know when the first Norwegians found their way to the western end of Gjende, but it has been determined that the first summer farms came in the early 1700s.
We know, for example, that some 8000 years ago, the forests reached higher than they do today.
We know, for example, that the wood line 8000 years ago was considerably higher than today.
We mention few names; the warden's job at a DNT lodge tends to be a life-long task that moreover often is passed on to the next generation.
We will leave that discussion alone, and instead contend that Knutshø is also worth a day trip from Gjendesheim; it is a «breezy», but totally safe trip.
We'll let that discussion rest, but contend that Knutshø also is worth a day hike from Gjendesheim; it's an exposed but completely safe hike.

Well down from Bukkelægeret, the trail goes ahead to Gjendebu, easily and fine along the shore of Gjende.
What's fine is that you can combine the hike onward towards Spiterstulen with a tour to the summit.
When DNT laid out its first marked route in the beginning of the 1870's, it went from Bessheim to Memurubu across Veslefjellet and down to Besseggen.
When DNT marked the first cairn route in the early 1870s, it ran also from Bessheim to Memurubu over Veslefjellet and down Besseggen.
When the first of our ancestors found their way all the way to the west end of Gjende isn't known, but it's obvious that the first summer dairies were built there as early as the early 18th century.
When the first tourists began to visit this part of the Jotunheimen sometime in the 19th century, it was possible therefore to find shelter in primitive herder's huts.
When you begin your descent, you should, however, pay attention to where you put your feet down.
When you start the descent, however, you should watch your step.
With Gjendesheim as your starting point, you can also make a week-long round trip that will take you through much of the finest that Jotunheimen has to offer, and that provides many possible side trips, including to the two tallest peaks in the entire country.
With a bit of goodwill, there's sleeping space for four people.
With a little cooperation, there is room for four persons to spend the night.
With a measure of good will the rock shelter accommodates four.
With a starting point at Gjendesheim, you can go on a week's hike round that takes you through much of the most magnificent that the Jotunheimen offers and has many possible side trips, among them the two highest peaks in the entire country.
With high water flow, crossing can be difficult, so you must go further up the hillside.
With time, the tracks after tens of thousands of hiking boots have made a broad, grey band over Veslefjellet, but you need not go many meters away from the trail to find that plants also grow at 1700 meters elevation.
You are best off with sturdy boots and an eye on the trail.
You can also go by boat.
You can buy a fishing license at the tourist lodges.
You can hike back to Gjendesheim on the eastern side of Lower Leirungen and Gjendeshø.
You can spend the night, take the boat back to Gjendesheim or onward to Gjendebu, or walk back to Gjendesheim along Gjende.
You can walk back to Gjendesheim by way of the east side of the lower Leirungen and Gjendeshø, completing the hike along the marked trail from Haugseter (see Booklet 2).
You climb towards Nedre Steinbuvatnet and follow along the ridge to the glacier's edge.
You cross several streams along the bank, which may be welcome if you need a break.
You do this after having crossed the bridge on the outlet at the eastern end.
You get, however, a better overview of the lake when you're on the other side.
You pass many streams on the stretch along the lake, and that's fine if you think you need a rest.
You will have a better overview of the lake, however, when you reach the other side.
You will hike the first kilometer up the hillside toward Gjendehalsen together with those who are headed across Besseggen, but at the fork in the trail, you will go to the right.
You will pass a number of brooks on the stretch along the lake, and these might be suitable stopping points if you need a rest.
Your view of the lake is better from the other side, however, after you have crossed the eastern outlet on a bridge, where there is also a tote road along the river down into Sjodalen.
