Yes, fine, then let's arrange an appointment.
When would it suit you?
Well, I thought within the next week, in any case still in April.
I would still have an appointment slot free on Tuesday, the sixth of April, but only in the afternoon.
Does that work for you too?
Oh, that is bad.
I have an appointment at the dentist at two thirty then.
But Thursday morning around nine would suit me.
Is that the eighth of April?
Oh, I was actually thinking of the fifteenth of April, a week later.
Hm that is the Thursday after Easter.
I will still be on vacation in Majorca then.
I have to say, I would prefer it if we postponed the whole business until May.
Does that work for you too?
Every afternoon after two o'clock is still free in my diary in the first week of May.
Good, do we want to do it right away on Monday then.
maybe at three thirty.
Oh, half past three is actually too late for me.
I have usually finished work by then.
Couldn't we agree on half past two then?
Let's say two forty-five instead.
Yes, a quarter to three is okay for me too.
Where should we meet then?
Should we meet at your office?
Okay, you will come to my office then.
My office is on the fourth floor.
So, on the third of May at a quarter to three, you will come to my office.
then let us arrange an appointment.
when would it suit you?
how about Tuesday, the thirteenth of April in the morning.
I am sorry.
on the thirteenth of April I will still be on vacation.
just like on Monday the twelfth of April.
I only have time again from the fourteenth of April on.
the fourteenth is a Wednesday.
but I already have a doctors appointment from nine to ten o'clock then.
so I would suggest the Thursday.
from ten to half past two in the afternoon I already have a meeting with doctoral students.
what was that again?
Yes, I said that I have a meeting with doctoral students on Tuesday.
yes the fifteenth of April from ten to half past two in the afternoon.
That almost never works for me anyway.
how about if we would meet on Monday instead.
Yes, Monday afternoon at some point in the morning.
which Monday do you mean?
how about the twelfth.
Monday the twelfth of April is already booked for me.
that is I am still on vacation then.
the fifth is also bad, but on Tuesday the sixteenth of April, I still have time the whole day.
the fifth is also bad, but I will still have time the whole day.
oh, too bad.
on the sixth of April I will unfortunately not be in.
how about if we would try it on Saturday for once then.
yes, on Saturday the tenth.
yes, Saturday suits me if we try it right in the morning.
not a bad suggestion.
how about at half past eight.
ah, please not before nine on Saturdays.
good, make a suggestion.
I would say at nine and then right here again.
Yes, I would be pleased if we arranged an appointment then.
When would it suit you?
Yes, I don't really know.
How about July?
I would still have time at the beginning of July.
At the end of July I will be on vacation.
As of when would you be on vacation then?
I wanted to go on vacation on Saturday the seventeenth of July.
We should arrange our appointment before then.
Would it be possible in the first week of July?
Yes, let's say Tuesday, the sixth of July.
I still have time then.
Tuesday is a bit inconvenient.
Could we perhaps do it on Thursday?
Do you mean Thursday the eighth or Thursday the fifteenth of July?
I would actually prefer Thursday the eighth of July.
Then I suggest Thursday the eighth of July at three thirty.
Could we possibly schedule that for the morning?
I would suggest between about ten and eleven o'clock.
How about a quarter to eleven?
Do you think that is enough?
You are right.
that will be a bit tight.
Maybe we should start right away at ten o'clock after all.
oh, that reminds me of something.
at that time I have to go to the dentist.
Oh, very sad.
Could you suggest another date?
maybe Friday the ninth of July?
That is a bit bad for me.
But I could still squeeze in an appointment at eleven o'clock.
Yes, I think that would be all right with me too.
Let's do it like that.
Do you want to come to my office?
Yes, we can do it like that.
I will come on Friday at eleven then.
